    -Car show resource will be rendered using jQuery
    - how to approach??
      1) create an internal API; review sections -- DONE
      2) create the AJAX that interact with that internal api and render info.


- [ ] Include an index resource rendered using jQuery and an Active Model Serialization JSON backend.
     - car index resource will be rendered using jQuery.
     1) create an internal API: done
     2) create the AJAX that interacts with the API endpoint and renders the info

- [ ] Include at least one has_many relationship in information rendered via JSON and appended to the DOM.
    -???
- [ ] Use your Rails API and a form to create a resource and render the response without a page refresh.
    -new resource form -- a bit simpler than the very complex new car form.  time is a factor here


- [ ] Translate JSON responses into js model objects.
